abstract: "What is the maximum number of _holes_ enclosed by a $d$-dimensional polycube built of $n$ tiles? Represent this number by $f_d(n)$.  Recent results show that $f_2(n)/n$ converges to $1/2$.  We prove that for all $d \geq 2$ we have $f_d(n)/n \to (d-1)/d$ as $n$ goes to infinity. We also construct polycubes in $d$-dimensional tori with the maximal possible number of holes per tile.  In our proofs, we use metaphors from error-correcting codes and dynamical systems."
