abstract: "For any fixed graph $G$, we prove that the topological connectivity of the graph homomorphism complex is at least $m-D(G)-2$, where $D(G)=\\max_{H\\subseteq G}\\delta(H)$, for $\\delta(H)$ the minimum degree of a vertex in a subgraph $H$. This generalizes a theorem of Cukic and Kozlov, in which the maximum degree $\\Delta(G)$ was used in place of $D(G)$, and provides a high-dimensional analogue of the graph theoretic bound for chromatic number, $\\chi(G)\\leq D(G)+1$, as $\\chi(G) = \\min\\{m:\\text{Hom} (G,K_{m})\\ne\\emptyset\\}$. Furthermore, we use this result to examine homological phase transitions in the random polyhedral complexes for a fixed constant $c > 0$."
